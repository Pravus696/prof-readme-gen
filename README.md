# Professional README Generator

## Description

  My motivation behind making this is to create a faster process for making README files for projects.

  I built this project so that many developers could use it for their projects. Allowing them more time to focus on creating their project.

  This generator will help new developers to create professional looking READMEs with ease.

  Throughout creating this project, I learned different ways to format text in a README file while using Javascript.

  My project stands out due its ease of use regardless of experience, and professional formatting.
